Shrink - Approximating the 2D medial axis

Approximate the 2D medial axis given a set of points sampled from a
shape and the normal vectors to the shape at those points.

This code can be used to obtain points inside a polygonal shape that are far
from the boundary of the shape. Thus, a good use case is providing a point for
placing a text label inside a 2D polygon.

The original 3D algorithm is described in:
